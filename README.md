## Info ##

**Mist** is a portable and lightweight Steam client that allows you to chat and trade with your friends on any computer that can run it. It is based on a heavily modified version of [SteamBot](https://github.com/Jessecar96/SteamBot). The program is publicly available under the MIT License.

Mist requires a Steam API key to run. If you do not have one, it can be requested from Value at their [Web API Key](http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) page. **This is required and Mist will not work without an API Key**.

Mist is licensed under the MIT License.  Check out LICENSE for more details.
